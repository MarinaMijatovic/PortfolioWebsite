## What is custom software development?
Custom software development is the process of designing, creating, deploying and maintaining software for a specific set of users, functions or organizations. 

### Example
Take for example the application for calculating salaries and costs for teachers and students in school of math . The main goal of this application was to ensure that teachers would get correct amount of payment, depending on the total number of working hours and grade that they got from their students. On the other hand, at the end of month, students should get bill for all classes they attended. Also, there are several ways to calculate bonuses for lecturers and discounts for students.
 
This application should have desktop version and mobile version. First version of this application was made in Python, but next upgraded versions will be moved to Flutter.
